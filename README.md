🌍 Problem We Solve
In today’s market, consumers are increasingly concerned about sustainability but often lack accessible information on how eco-friendly the products they buy actually are. Details such as:

The recyclability of packaging

The carbon footprint of manufacturing

Ethical sourcing of materials

...are either not available, buried in fine print, or simply too technical to understand.

This leads to uninformed purchases, even by well-meaning buyers, and doesn’t pressure companies to be more transparent.

💡 Our Solution
Eco-Scan solves this by allowing users to scan invisible patterns embedded on products, which fetch comprehensive eco-reports instantly. These reports break down:

Environmental impact score

Material details (recyclability, origin)

Carbon emissions

Brand sustainability rating

✅ Simple Scan ➡ Clear Insights ➡ Smarter, Greener Choices.

This app was submitted for the Google Solution Challenge 2025, under the umbrella of using technology to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) — especially Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.
